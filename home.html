        <h3 style="color: white">Entry #1:</h3>
        <p style="color: white">This is Day 1 of making the math portfolio. The entire process of making this website will be recorded in the home page,
            so you get to see how the code changed over time. All the tutorials and websites I used are in the references page. Excpect 
            a lot of rants and unfiltered thoughts in these entries. Yes, this will be more unfiltered than the Random Thoughts Page.
            Let's hope we'll do just fine! (definitely not foreshadowing) This is as bare-bones as it gets (hopefully). Making this portfolio
            will be a very tedious and tiring project, especially considering the fact I've only made like 3 total websites in my life 😭. Also,
            because this is my website and I can do whatever I want with it, I might type with varying slang and emojis depending on my mood
            and energy levels when making this. Soooooooo ummmmmm, essentially this is the page where you get to see detailed accounts of every day I work on this 
            project. Im trying to make this paragraph pretty long so it kind of looks professional (even with the emojis 💀). Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet filler text
            blah blah blah. Testing testing 1, 2, 3.

        <h3 class="post-summary" style="color: white;">Entry #2:</h3>
        <p style="color: white;">This is my second log for this page, it's 7:29AM right now and I'm just adding and tweaking some minor stuff because I have some spare
            time anyway. This won't be my only log for today, so don't expect a summary right after this. A few major changes I've made to yesterday's website is that
            I made the background black, so it's easier on the eyes, and I even made the navigation bar always be present no matter how far you scroll. I started working at
            exactly 6:27AM. If I still have track of time by the very last log of this project, I'll be impressed. This page is honestly just to give my portfolio more personality
            than just the usual 'Random Thoughts' section I put at the end of every portfolio. I'm still typing pretty formally, and I think that's a good sign. No coffee has
            been consumed yet, because I think the cup I drank last night is still in my system. Another major thing I did was organize the file names of all the code screenshots.
            Let's all be proud of me for a moment. 
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: white;">Entry #3:</h3>
        <p style="color: white;">This is day 3, and that was indeed the last entry for day 2 💔. I 
            should probably learn from my mistakes and drink coffee this time, because when I got home 
            yesterday, I went straight to sleep 💀. Also, I didn't do anything major to the code, so I won't be 
            uploading images of them for day 2. Anyways, here's the summary for yesterday:</p>

        <h2 class="summary">Day 2 Summary:</h2>
        <p class="summary"> Start time: 6:27AM</p>
        <p class="summary"> End time: 7:29AM</p>
        <p class="summary"> Total Tutorials Watched/Read: 4</p>
        <p class="summary"> Total Cups of Iced Coffee Drank: 1</p>
        <p class="summary"> Will to Live: 89% </p>

        <h3 class="post-summary" style="color: white;">Entry #4:</h3>
        <p style="color: white;">Today is Day 4, and if you're wondering why there's no summary for day 3, it's 
            because I was being very productive yesterday... in a minecraft server making a base. Yes, I procrastinated a portfolio,
            lock me up officer! Anyways, there's gonna be another entry later, I started working on this at 10:30PM today and it's currently 
            11:33PM. Because of my great time-management skills, I decided that iced coffee is too weak, so I just chugged an entire cup 
            of hot black coffee. I'm running on coffee, willpower, and music. I also decided that after the very last entry, I might 
            upload a graph of all the summaries that I've posted in here. I wonder what that would look like lol. Wait, my attention-deficit 
            self forgot that I'm here to update you on the progress I've made so far. Here it is: Look at the tab title, you see that little pixelated
            drawing? THAT TOOK A WHOLE HOUR. Mostly just debugging and me trying to not have a mental breakdown but also like 5 minutes of me doodling that 
            face. You better appreciate that face... Also because I'm doing some major stuff that I may or may not disclose, You'll get more snippets of the code 
            yay... 
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: white;">Entry #5:</h3>
        <p style="color: white;">Technically, It's day 5 because it's 2:30 IN THE MORNING. I WANT TO SLEEP!!! SCREENSHOTS OF CODE WILL BE UPLOADED TOMORROW,
            I'LL JUST DO THE SUMMARY AND GO TO SLEEP. Also, some of the code might be redacted to not spoil the portfolio in case you actually read this. anyways 
            im very tired. peace out gais 🫩✌️
