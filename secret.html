    <h1>You've made it! Good job, now you get to read a really mediocre yap on how sets are applied
        to this portfolio 💔
    </h1>

    <p>so basically like the entire experience [website, gdocs, fake buffering screen, and random thoughts] are
        all part of my portfolio, so think of it as like the set of all real numbers. then like the website homepage is the biggest
        subset because you can access all the stuff from it, but it doesn't count as the whole portfolio, this is pretty much the set of all rational
        numbers in a way. set of integers is basically, all the other places you can go from my website  [home, portfolio, random thoughts, and buy me coffee section]
        the set of whole numbers is the fake buffering screen, and the smallest of all, the set of natural numbers is where you are right now! i know this is kind of a mid-bad
        explanation, and thats because i'm expecting the experience of this website to kind of make a sort of visualization of what i just typed. unfortunately, this is the actual
        "main" content of it i guess, so there's no more secret links or anything [or not 😈]. anyways, here's a link back to the home page in case you didn't fully explore everything yet.
